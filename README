DBUP - database sharing helper

VERSION:
0.1

DESCRIPTION:
Helps to maintain local development database instances and one main database storage in a source code repository (in form of database creation scripts).
It should be run in the source code repository directory where the sql scripts and some configuration will be placed.
Each run does these 2 steps:
1. Applying scripts from the repository to your local database.
2. Helping with creating scripts in the repository which reflect changes in your local database.
Applying of these 2 steps (maybe in more iterations) makes the local database synchronized with the repository.

USAGE DESCRIPTION:
Please note that these descriptions refer to the state when everyone already has their development databases in some state. However, the instructions can be applied to the cases of creating new development databases, too. Just imagine that you already have a development database, but it is empty.

A. I have a local development database and want to put its state to a shared repository (e.g. a GIT repository) to share/synchronize the database with others (who maybe have their own development databases already).

1. Create an empty directory in your repository working copy.
- this directory will serve as a main source for the database state
- if you have more development databases (e.g. one for a core system and one for a web interface), you have to deal with each database separately, thus creating such directory in your repository for each database

2. Set up the tool (fill the configuration file).
- run the tool in that empty directory for the first time
- it will complain about missing settings
- fill the settings file; see: C. Common instructions - settings file

3. Set up database versioning.
- run the tool with settings filled in; see: D. Common instructions - database versioning

4. Add database scripts to the repository.
- see E. Common instructions - adding database scripts to the repository

5. Commit.
- commit the directory dedicated to the database to the shared repository
- the directory now contains scripts (in the "scripts" directory) which can be used to create new database in the desired state or to synchronize an existing database

B. Someone has already put their repository state to our shared repository. I want to synchronize my own development database to reflect the state in the repository.

1. Checkout the repository and find the database directory
- the database directory should contain a directory called "scripts" and maybe .gitignore, ignore_data.txt and ignore_tables.txt files

2. Set up the tool (fill the configuration file).
- run the tool in that directory for the first time
- it will complain about missing settings
- fill the settings file; see: C. Common instructions - settings file

3. Set up database versioning.
- run the tool with settings filled in; see: D. Common instructions - database versioning

4. Apply scripts to your local database.
- review the scripts you checked out from the repository
- the tool will ask you if it can apply each script automatically; but maybe you will have to make some changes in your local development database manually and let the tool increment the database version only
- after all scripts are applied, the tool helps you to add scripts reflecting your own database changes to the repository; see: E. Common instructions - adding database scripts to the repository

5. Commit
- commit new .sql scripts to the shared repository

C. Common instructions - settings file
- you have to set up two databases:
-- the "local" database is your development database
-- the "temp" database is a (empty) temporary database - it will be used by this tool for simulating a database reflecting the repository state and will be cleaned before each run (so be careful to set it to an empty database; not to some database you are using for something)

D. Common instructions - database versioning
- if your local development database does not contain version information, the tool will ask you if it can add the version information - that is adding one table to your database where the version info will be stored

E. Common instructions - adding database scripts to the repository
- the tool will tell you what add to the repository so that the repository will exactly reflect your local development database
- you will have to repeat this step until the tool prints nothing (the tool prints nothing only if everything is in a correct, synchronized state - if the repository exactly reflects your local development database)
- note the contents of the "outs" directory after each run, there are some created scripts that you can use when creating the scripts in the repository
- the scripts must be named in the following way: <version>_<description>.sql
-- version is the version which will the database have after applying this script (a number must be aligned to six digits, first version is 000001, no version can be left out)
-- description is your own description (e.g. create_table_user, fill_users, delete_table_user)
- note that after adding scripts to the repository and running the tool again, you will have a version mismatch (the repository version will be higher that your local development database version)
-- the tool asks you, if you want to apply the repository scripts to upgrade your local development database to the repository state
-- because you already have the desired state provided by the scripts in your local development database (becuase you created the scripts from the state of the database), you can ignore this mismatch and answer with "nall" (this only sets the version of the local development database to the version provided by the scripts)
- of course, you will have some specific tables or data in your local development database, which you do not want to share (which do not form the base database state), this can be e.g. data about users which you have added while testing etc.
-- list tables you want to ignore in the ignore_tabes.txt file (one table name on one line)
-- list tables which data have to be ignored in the ignore_data.txt file (one table name on one line)
--- additionally, you can list conditions for ignored data (e.g. "user id = 1 OR id > 4") will ignore records in the table user which have ID 1 or ID greater than 4
-- the *local.txt files are there for the ignore lists which you do not want to share in the repository
